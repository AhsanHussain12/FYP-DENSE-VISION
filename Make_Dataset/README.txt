### Instructions for Using `mark_image.py`

To use the `mark_image.py` tool, follow these steps:

1. **Provide Image Folder Path**:
   - Run `mark_image.py` with the path to the folder containing the images you want to mark.

2. **Prepare Folder Structure**:
   - Ensure there's a `ground_truth` folder inside the same directory as your images folder. This folder will store the output files.

3. **Marking Images**:
   - **Mark Points**: Click to mark points on the image.
   - **Next Image**: When you're done marking, close the current image window to automatically load the next image in the sequence.

4. **Exiting the Process**:
   - To exit the program, press **Ctrl + C**.

This setup will help save your annotations to the `ground_truth` folder with each image.
